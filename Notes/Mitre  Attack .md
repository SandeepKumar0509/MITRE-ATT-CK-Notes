# What is MITRE ATT&CK ?


Firstly we will understand its full form ,it comprises two word - MITRE AND ATT&CK

`MITRE`: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research and Engineering                        

`ATT&CK`  : 'Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge

Definition : A malicious attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer, without knowing him and do some  illegal activity to his computer and steal some important  information.

# Main Points #

# 1. Tactics - 

It represent the main aim to achieve to achieve while doing a cyber attack. It simply means to gain unauthourized access to computer.

 # 2.Techniques -
 
 It mainly means the  method through which the attack can be done It is the specific methods or procedures that adversaries employ to accomplish their tactical objectives.

 # 3. Procedures -
 It mainly focuses on detalied study about  more detailed understanding of how adversaries operate and can help defenders tailor their defenses accordingly.

# Basically there are three main points of Mitre Att&ck (TTPs)
 # 1.Tactics
 # 2. Techniques 
 # 3. Procedures

 It mainly tells us about the level of accessing some tools  like domain name,ip addrress ,hash values and many other tools as descibed in this picture .

 # 5. Mitigations
 Mitigation is the application of policies, technologies and procedures to reduce the overall impact and risk of a cyber threat. It is a critical practice to help guide decision-making around risk control and mitigation and allow your organization to stay protected and achieve its business goals.

 #  Basically there are two types of thoughts of approaches

# 1.Think as A Defender
# 2.Think as a Attacker

 # Basically Mitre has 14 types of tactics ( which is shown in the picture)

# Threat Hunting 

It is a security function that combines proactive methodology, innovative technology, and threat intelligence to find and stop malicious activities.



 # Mitre Framework 
  It  is a curated knowledge base that tracks cyber adversary tactics and techniques used by threat actors across the entire attack lifecycle.
  # 1. Enterprise

  # 2. ICS

  # 3. Mobile

 
## Using the ATT&CK Framework

# 1. Threat Intelligence

ATT&CK provides a common language for sharing and analyzing threat intelligence.  Researchers can use the framework to categorize observed behaviors, identify trends, and understand the tactics and techniques used  by different threat actors.

# 2. Red Team Exercises

It  involve simulating real-world attacks to assess an organization's security posture. By mapping their tactics and techniques to the ATT&CK framework, red teams can find  the behavior of actual adversaries and help organizations identify and address security gaps.

# 3. Blue Team Analysis
 It is responsible for defending against cyber threats, can use the ATT&CK framework to improve their detection and response capabilities. By easily  understanding the tactics and techniques commonly used by adversaries, it  can develop more effective strategies for threat detection, incident response, and remediation.

 # Conclusion of Mitre Att&ck
 
 The MITRE ATT&CK Framework catalogs information that correlates adversary groups to campaigns, so security teams can better understand the adversaries they are dealing with, evaluate their defenses, and strengthen security where it matters most.
